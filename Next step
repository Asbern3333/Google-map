Now if I want to publish it online for free can I?
Yes, but with limits. You can host your frontend for free, but the backend that calls Google APIs needs a real server because:

It uses your private Google API key (must stay hidden).

Free hosts limit runtime and outbound requests.

Here’s the practical breakdown:

✅ Frontend (HTML/JS)

You can host it free on:

GitHub Pages

Netlify

Vercel

Those hosts can serve your /public/index.html.
But your backend must be online too.

⚙️ Backend (Node.js + Express)

You can host it free on one of these:

Render.com — Free tier, simple setup.

Create a new “Web Service”.

Connect your GitHub repo.

Add node server.js as start command.

Add your Google API key as an environment variable.

Railway.app — Free up to limited monthly hours.

Vercel Functions — Works but more setup.

🧱 Steps to publish (example: Render.com)

Push your whole project to GitHub.

Go to https://render.com
.

Create account → “New Web Service” → Connect repo.

In “Environment Variables” add:

GOOGLE_KEY=your_google_api_key


In your server.js, replace the hardcoded key with:

const GOOGLE_KEY = process.env.GOOGLE_KEY;


Deploy. Render gives you a public URL like:

https://your-app-name.onrender.com


Update the fetch() call in your frontend (index.html) to use that URL instead of http://localhost:3000/export.

⚠️ Notes

Free tiers sleep after inactivity.

Google API has daily quota limits.

Never expose your API key in frontend code.

Would you like me to prepare the exact file edits for publishing it on Render.com safely?
